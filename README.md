# Santander Product Recommendation

Santander is challenging users in Kaggle to predict which products their existing customers will use in the next month based on their past behavior and that of similar customers.

With a more effective recommendation system in place, Santander can better meet the individual needs of all customers and ensure their satisfaction no matter where they are in life.

In this project, I provide a graphical analysis and data preparation of this huge dataset. In order to extract as much information as possible, I reduce its memory size so I could work with it completely. Finally, I create a model to predict according to a customer's behavior whether or not this customer will buy a product from Banco Santander in the last month.

## Data

Due to the repository size limits, I can't upload full dataset used.
Instead you can found all the data used on [Santander Product Recommendation - Kaggle Competition.](https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-product-recommendation/)  
Despite the problem, I upload memory reduction script and the already reduced files.

	data_modelling_memred.pkl.zip
	memory-reduction-script.py
